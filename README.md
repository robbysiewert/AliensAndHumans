# AliensAndHumans
# After learning Java, I made this aliens and humans project to solidify my skills in object oriented design principles in Java and gain familiarity with JUnit testing.
# The project creates instances of humans and aliens, which inherit attributes from the Entity class, and fight each other using weapons, in the context of an environment.
